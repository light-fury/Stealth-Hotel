            Hospitality Brands is committed to not only taking concrete steps
            to reduce it’s carbon footprint, but leading the charge to bring
            environmentally sustainable products to the hospitality industry.
            Our catalog includes 100% recyclable glass, developed completely
            sustain- ably, ensuring environmentally concious production,
            without any compromise on style of quality. We’re also proud to
            offer 100% recyclable Unbreakable Drinkware, which thanks to being
            virtually indesctructible, can be reused for up to 2000 cycles in
            the dishwaser and reduce the need to re-order glassware,
            ultimately reducing waste. And for 2020, we’re proud to introduce
            ECO-CRYSTAL to the market, the first ultra clear crystal glassware
            produced completely in emission free factories in Europe’s first
            carbon negative region.
